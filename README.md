# CSCIE15 Project - P4 ZUDBU
## 1. Summary
**Zudbu** is dedicated to providing reliable information to people interested in nurturing their body, mind and spirit.
- Reliable:  based on scientific research,  verifiable, from reputable sources.
- Nurturing body, mind and spirit: Promoting overall health and well-being with a focus on prevention.


The main reasoning behind the creation of Zudbu is the realization that our healthcare spend is too much and in the wrong place  (i.e., healing preventable diseases or ailments).  For perspective, according to Forbes, the annual US. Healthcare Spend has hit [$3.8 Trillion](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/02/02/annual-u-s-healthcare-spending-hits-3-8-trillion/). The larger issue is that health outcomes are not in line with the spend, with the [US ranking last](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/06/16/u-s-healthcare-ranked-dead-last-compared-to-10-other-countries/) in a list of 11 developed countries.  

Zudbu is not about providing medical advice to individuals that require treatment. The goal of Zudbu is to inform those interested in  prevention activities and well-being in general. There are many internet sites that provide advice about well being, but the information they contain is simply not supported by evidence.  Zudbuâ€™s intent is to fill this gap.
