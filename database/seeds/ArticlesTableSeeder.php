            <p>There is strong evidence that dequate levels of physical activity
            have a number of health benefits, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lower rates of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease,
              high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer and breast
              cancer</li>
              <li>Higher level of cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, functional
              health,  healthier body mass and composition, and better cognitive
              functions</li>
              <li>Biomarker profile that is more favourable for the prevention
              of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and the enhancement of

            important to know when to stop exercise to prevent joint damage,
            dehydration, and in extreme cases heart attacks</p>

            <p>According to the world healt organization, the recommended amount of
             physical activity varies by age group:</p>

             <ul>
              <li>Children and youth aged 5â€“17 should accumulate at least 60 minutes
              of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily.
              Amounts of physical activity greater than 60 minutes provide
              additional health benefits.
              Most of the daily physical activity should be aerobic.</li>
              <li>Adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
              aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75
              minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout
              the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.

                 <p>Some examples of processed meat include:</p>
                 <ul>
                   <li>sausages</li>

                 meat and follow a diet based on fresh products.  It is important that these

                <p>Driking patterns have changed substantially.  There is some evidence
                that moderate drinking may have cardiovascular benefits.  However, these
                these benefits are probably overstated and require very small amounts of
                alcohol consumption.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there is strong evidence linking high alcohol consumption
                with with a number of downsides:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Increase in breast cancer risk </li>
                  <li>Increased mortality</li>
                  <li>Obesity (which is associated with several other health issues)</li>
                  <li>Increased risk of liver failure</li>
                  <li>Reincidence and new lesions in patients with Coronary Heart Disease</li>

                </ul>

                <p> Despite the evidence, many people still have the impression that alcohol
                drinking is healthy and is associated with cardiovascular benefits.
                The "french paradox" is commonly quoted as evidence.  There are
                several things that are important to know about this:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>The french paradox refers to a relatively low incidence of
                  Coronary Heart Disease in French People, while having a diet rich
                  in saturated fats. </li>
                  <li>This term was first used in the newsletter of the
                  International Organization of Vine and Wine</li>
                  <li>The hypotesis linking fats french paradox may or may not be valid</li>
                </ul>

                 <p>The bottomline is that alcohol drinking is not a medicine and should
                 be done in moderation and over time.  If you want to have a healthy heart you are
                 better off eating in moderation (a mediterranean diet
                 is a good idea), reducing your stress levels, and exercising regularly</p>',
