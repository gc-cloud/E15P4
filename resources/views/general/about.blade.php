  <p>Our mission is to help people achieve and maintain wellnes.  We believe that
    the best way to do this is by focusing on prevention. Our strategy is to
    provide reliable and straightforward facts  to people interested in
    nurturing their body, mind and spirit.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reliable:  based on scientific research,  verifiable, from reputable sources.</li>
      <li>Simple:  Get to the point.  Drilldown on details and non essential information
        only when reader wants to.</li>
      <li>Nurturing body, mind and spirit: Promoting overall health and well-being
      with a focus on prevention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The main reasoning behind the creation of facts4wellness is the realization that our
    healthcare spend is too much and in the wrong place  (i.e., healing preventable
    diseases or ailments).  For perspective, according to Forbes, the annual US.
    Healthcare Spend has hit $3.8 Trillion. The larger issue is that health
    outcomes are not in line with the spend, with the US ranking last in a list of
    11 developed countries.
