    Zudbu is dedicated to providing reliable information to people interested in
    nurturing their body, mind and spirit.
    <ul>
      <li>Reliable:  based on scientific research,  verifiable, from reputable sources.</li>
      <li>Nurturing body, mind and spirit: Promoting overall health and well-being
      with a focus on prevention</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The main reasoning behind the creation of Zudbu is the realization that our
    healthcare spend is too much and in the wrong place  (i.e., healing preventable
    diseases or ailments).  For perspective, according to Forbes, the annual US.
    Healthcare Spend has hit $3.8 Trillion. The larger issue is that health
    outcomes are not in line with the spend, with the US ranking last in a list of
    11 developed countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of Zudbu is to inform those interested in  prevention
    activities and well-being in general. There are many internet sites that
    provide advice about well being, but the information they contain is not
    always supported by evidence .  Zudbuâ€™s intent is to fill this gap.
