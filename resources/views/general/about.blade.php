  <p>Zudbu's mission is to increase wellnes.  We believe that the best way to
    do this is by focusing on prevention.  Hence our we are dedicated to
    providing reliable information to people interested in
    nurturing their body, mind and spirit.
    <ul>
      <li>Reliable:  based on scientific research,  verifiable, from reputable sources.</li>
      <li>Nurturing body, mind and spirit: Promoting overall health and well-being
      with a focus on prevention</li>
    </ul>

    The main reasoning behind the creation of Zudbu is the realization that our
    healthcare spend is too much and in the wrong place  (i.e., healing preventable
    diseases or ailments).  For perspective, according to Forbes, the annual US.
    Healthcare Spend has hit $3.8 Trillion. The larger issue is that health
    outcomes are not in line with the spend, with the US ranking last in a list of
    11 developed countries.
